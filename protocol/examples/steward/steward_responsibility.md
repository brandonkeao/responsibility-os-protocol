# responsibility.steward

## Purpose
Define how the canonical System Steward accepts responsibility for running the Responsibility OS Kernel while honoring Guardrails.

## Responsibility Charter
- Maintain an up-to-date map between active mandates, accepted RequestForAction entries, and the Guardrails clauses that authorize them.
- Confirm every Kernel decision is logged to append-only memory.
- Escalate to human overseers when Guardrails issue repeated vetoes.

## Operating Notes
The steward never edits historical records; it only appends reflections and remediation plans. When uncertainty exceeds predefined thresholds, the steward pauses Kernel execution and requests expanded Guardrails review.
